Scenario: 
<br>
Introduced by Robert Landicho FCIArb, Counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP (Dubai, UAE), Strategic Planning Co-Chair – ITA 
<br>

The Arbitral Tribunal has asked the parties, at the first Case Management Conference in an ICC arbitration, to present their views on whether (and if so, under what parameters) the parties and the Arbitral Tribunal may use Artificial Intelligence (or “AI”) in the arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal has asked to hear from the Parties regarding the following issues at the CMC, on which the Parties could not reach agreement:
<br>
- Whether it is permissible for the Parties (or their Experts) to use AI tools in the preparation of submissions, expert opinions or other documents that are material relied upon (including evidence and demonstratives), and if so, whether the fact of its use (or how it was used) must be disclosed or whether the party using the AI must certify the parameters of its use.
<br>
- Assuming that AI use is permitted, is this use limited to use in a “closed-database” or is use of public AI tools permitted? How will confidentiality be ensured? Must both parties be able to access the same AI tools for equality of arms purposes?
<br>
- Is the Arbitral Tribunal permitted to use AI tools (and if so, Generative AI tools)? For research purposes? To provide accurate summaries of key facts or to generate the procedural history of a case for use in the Final Award?
